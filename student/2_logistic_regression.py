# We load the Iris dataset using load_iris from sklearn.datasets.
# The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.

# Define the Model Architecture and Loss Function:
# We define the logistic regression model using tf.keras.Sequential.
# The model consists of a single dense layer with 3 units (one for each class) and a softmax activation function.
# The loss function is defined as SparseCategoricalCrossentropy, which is suitable for multi-class classification problems.

# Define the model architecture and loss function

# We define the optimizer as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) with a learning rate of 0.01.

# Randomly Select an Instance from the Test Dataset:

# We randomly select an index (random_idx) from the test dataset.
# The corresponding input features and actual label are retrieved from X_test and y_test, respectively.
# Predict the Class Probabilities for the Selected Instance:

# The selected instance (sample) is reshaped to match the model's input shape using np.expand_dims.
# The model predicts the class probabilities for the selected instance using model(sample).
# The predicted label is obtained by finding the index of the maximum probability using tf.argmax.
# Print the Predicted and Actual Labels:

# The class names are obtained from iris.target_names.
# The predicted and actual labels are printed to compare the model's prediction with the actual value.
