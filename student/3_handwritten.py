# Neural Networks: Neural networks are a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain's structure and functioning. They consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons called "neurons." Each neuron receives input, performs a computation, and produces an output.
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist

# Load the MNIST dataset: The MNIST dataset contains a large collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels. We use the mnist.load_data() function from the tensorflow.keras.datasets module to load the dataset. It returns two tuples, one for training data and labels, and the other for test data and labels.
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Normalize pixel values: The pixel values in the MNIST images range from 0 to 255. To facilitate training, we normalize the pixel values to the range of 0 to 1 by dividing each value by 255.
# Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1]
X_train = 
X_test = 
# Convert labels to one-hot encoding: The labels in the MNIST dataset are integers from 0 to 9, representing the digits. For multiclass classification, we convert the labels into one-hot encoded vectors using tf.keras.utils.to_categorical. This step transforms the labels into binary vectors, where the index corresponding to the label is set to 1, and all other indices are set to 0.
# Convert the labels to one-hot encoded vectors
y_train = 
y_test = 
# Define the model architecture: We create a sequential model using tf.keras.Sequential. The model consists of three layers: a flatten layer to convert the 2D input images into a 1D vector, a dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation, and a dense output layer with 10 units (corresponding to the 10 digit classes) and softmax activation.
# Define the model architecture
model = 
# Compile the model: Before training, we need to compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics. In this case, we use the Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss (suitable for multiclass classification), and track accuracy as the metric.
# Compile the model
model.compile(

)
# Train the model: We use the fit method to train the model on the training data. We specify the number of epochs (iterations over the entire dataset) and the batch size (the number of samples per gradient update).
# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)
# Evaluate the model: After training, we evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset using the evaluate method. This computes the loss and accuracy of the model on the unseen test data.
# Evaluate the model on the test dataset
loss, accuracy = 
print(f'Test Loss: {loss:.4f}')
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}')

# Predict values for the test dataset: To make predictions, we use the predict method and pass the test dataset as input. We retrieve the predicted labels by taking the argmax along the predicted probabilities axis.
# Predict values for the test dataset
predictions = model.predict(X_test[:10])
predicted_labels = tf.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
# Print predicted and actual labels: Finally, we print the predicted labels and actual labels for the first 10 examples in the test dataset. The argmax function helps us find the index of the maximum value, which corresponds to the predicted or actual label.
# Print the predicted labels and actual labels
actual_labels = tf.argmax(y_test[:10], axis=1)
print("Predicted Labels:", predicted_labels.numpy())
print("Actual Labels:", actual_labels.numpy())
